#### Description: 
This project is a web application designed for Trading Card Game (TCG) players to systematically track and analyze deck performance. It provides an interface, optimized for mobile use, allowing rapid logging of match outcomes, opponent deck types, and win/loss conditions. The backend, built with Python and Flask, processes this data to generate performance statistics, such as overall win rates and matchup-specific results. A JavaScript front end renders this information. Data persistence is managed via SQLite during development and PostgreSQL in production, ensuring scalability and data integrity essential for performance analysis.
TCG Tracker is a web app that uses JavaScript for its front end and has a significant focus on user experience and interface. One of the problems the app aims to solve is that TCG Players typically don't want to spend much time logging information; they want to focus on playing and winning games. Consequently, the app needed to be as simple and lightweight as possible. That's why the app is straightforward enough for users to log information quickly but provides all the minimal information required to meet the goal of delivering valuable insights, enabling a TCG Player to make the best decisions with their decks based on actual performance data.
The app is based on the 'My Decks' section, where users are able to create, add, and start tracking their decks. While creating a new deck, users can select a Deck Type, define its name, and add optional Tags for organizational purposes. The first iteration of the app is specifically related to Magic: The Gathering (MTG), so MTG players are able to identify specific Commanders for their Commander decks, a key feature for players of that popular format.
Once created, Decks within the 'My Decks' section are sorted by default by 'Last Played' date, but users can also sort their Decks alphabetically by 'Deck Name', by calculated 'Win Rate' (which shows the percentage of matches won versus total matches played), by the total number of 'Matches Played', and by 'Date Added'. They can also filter the displayed Decks by selecting a specific game Format or one or more assigned Tags for focused viewing.
The decks are shown using a visual 'card' element, allowing for easy visibility and sorting within both mobile and desktop user experiences. These deck cards display key details and feature a color-coded background based on their calculated Win Rate: red is associated with a Win Rate below 40%, yellow indicates a Win Rate between 40% and 60%, and green signifies a Win Rate above 60%. This intuitive system allows users to easily understand at a glance which decks have better overall performance.
Decks can be edited by users, allowing them to change their name or even delete them completely if needed. Furthermore, Tags can be easily added to or removed from Decks at any time, empowering users to readily organize their Decks using Tags. This feature maximizes flexibility to accommodate different TCGs and individual player organizational needs.
Once created, Decks can start having individual Matches associated with them. Each Match can be recorded as Won, Loss, or Draw for the corresponding Deck. This system allows users to easily and quickly log their results throughout the day, particularly useful while playing at Leagues or Tournaments. They can select a specific Deck to log results against, or they can perform this action within the dedicated 'My Matches' section. Matches can also be associated with Tags, enabling players to easily connect their match data with a Tag that links them to the relevant League or Tournament, the kind of Deck they were playing against, or any other characteristic of the Match that might be relevant for later analysis. Once again, this design choice maximizes flexibility for users.
The 'My Matches' section offers users the option to filter their logged Matches by associated Tags. The matches displayed in this section are sorted by default from newest to oldest ('new to old'), allowing users to have easy access to review their latest played games and performance trends.
Additionally, the 'My Tags' section allows users to easily view all the Decks and Matches that are currently connected with one or more specific Tags. This way, users gain a complete understanding of all the items within the app that utilize a particular Tag, thereby maximizing organizational capabilities and offering enhanced flexibility for analysis. Users can easily add or remove Tags from both Decks and Matches directly, and these changes automatically update the list of associated elements displayed on the 'My Tags' page, ensuring data consistency.
TCG Tracker requires users to register with a unique username and password to start using the application and track their personal data. The application utilizes Flask secrets to manage the user session securely, helping to avoid potential cyber-attacks related to session handling. Furthermore, it employs a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) compatible token mechanism, which significantly reduces its vulnerability to certain types of web attacks.
For user convenience, active sessions are persistent. This means users remain logged in on the app across browser sessions until they explicitly choose to log out by pressing the 'Logout' option provided within the application's menu structure.
