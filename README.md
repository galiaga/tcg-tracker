#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/aRYaDvsCBSA
#### Description: 
This project is a web application designed for Trading Card Game players to systematically track and analyze deck performance. It provides an interface, optimized for mobile use, allowing rapid logging of match outcomes, opponent deck types, and win/loss conditions. The backend, built with Python/Flask, processes this data to generate performance statistics, such as overall win rates and matchup-specific results. A JavaScript frontend renders this information. Data persistence is managed via SQLite during development and PostgreSQL in production, ensuring scalability and data integrity for performance analysis.
